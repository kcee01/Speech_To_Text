00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The Pythonist

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
On the previous episode

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Understanding History of Python

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Before coding in Python is important.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Today, the Python language of everything, web development, data science, machine learning, automation, AI tools and chatbots.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Now on the next episode.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:35,000
In the next episode, two first Python project, objectives are, understand what a variable is, something that stores information.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Stores Hello World in a variable called greeting.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Print it to the screen using print function.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Today I'm going to teach you how to write your first Python project, which is the first Python project at simple.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,000
You store hello world into a variable and then you take that variable.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:11,000
You put it into a function, a built-in function called print so that it can't display it to the screen.

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So set back, relax, let's start typing.

14

Print function contained greeting variable.

30
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Run Python followed by script name here the script name is HelloWorld.py.

31
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Check online courses here at DataCamp.

32
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:27,000
